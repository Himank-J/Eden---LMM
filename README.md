# Eden: Small Multi-Modal 

## üéØ Objective: 


The project aimed to finetune a multi-modal language model that accepts text, image, and audio inputs and generates text output based on a query.

---

## üìë Dataset:

- Instruct 150k: A carefully curated dataset designed to enhance the model‚Äôs instruction-following capabilities.
- COCO Images: Original images from the COCO dataset were paired with text data to create a rich, multi-modal learning environment.

## :basecamp: Model Architecture:

- Llava Model Approach: The project adopted a Llava-like framework, leveraging the CLIP model for image embeddings. These embeddings were fine-tuned for textual alignment.

- CLIP Pretrained Model:

  - Extracts image embeddings which are then adjusted to align with text representations.

- Projection Layer:

  - A transformation layer that adjusts CLIP image embeddings into a form that is compatible with the downstream language model, ensuring seamless integration with Phi3.5.

- Phi3.5_mini_instruct Model:

  - Acts as the core language model (SLM).
  - Fine-tuned using QLora for efficient instruction-tuning and to comprehend image embeddings effectively.

- Whisper for Audio:

  - Whisper model converts audio inputs into text, which is combined with other textual data and questions.
  - Both the audio-converted text and original textual inputs are passed to the Phi3.5 layer for comprehensive processing.

--- 

## üìç Deployment:

- The final model was deployed on Huggingface, allowing users to submit multi-modal inputs (image, audio, and/or text) along with a query.
- The model generates a coherent text-based output, informed by all available input modalities and the given question.

---

## ‚≠ê Significance: 
This model demonstrates a flexible and scalable approach to multi-modal AI by integrating advanced models like CLIP, Phi3.5, and Whisper, enabling real-world applications such as conversational AI, visual Q&A, and multimedia interpretation.
